# Database for movies, shows and music albums that IÂ´ve watched/heard. 

My goal is to practise and apply my knowledge of SQL on this fun little project. There are 3 tables, namely,
_Movies_, _Shows_,_Music_Albums_, and on each table, the title,release date, year and review for each. The idea is to replicate
what the LetterBox app does but for music and shows aswell, and not _just_ movies.
